## Use of the site can be summed up with the following user story:
* At the landing page, the user is presented with an interface where they can enter title of their note with message. Once the note is entered, they can delete or add new notes. Also they can update the note.

 To fulfill the requirement of this assignment, I have used many ressoures which include but are not limited to mdn documentation, momentjs, google api, CDN documentation, and class activities.
 # User Story
---
*  The web app was created using diffeent techonologies: NODE js, EXPRESS js, Insomnia, Heroku. I set up two routes for handling different types of requests.  I also deployed your application to Heroku.I run a Node.js web server using Express.js and handled two types of GET requests using parameters
I reated a production-ready application and deployed it to Heroku.
---
Create a different type of API endpoint to accept incoming (often called POST) data from a client's request. I Implementedfunctionality called middleware so our server can understand the type of data we are looking to post.
I used a tool called Insomnia to test POST requests while we wait for a finished front end.

* Used the Express.js app.post() method to create POST routes that accept incoming data from a client request.
* Implemented middleware functionality provided by Express.js to turn our incoming POST data into JSON data.
* Used Insomnia to test our POST requests while we wait for the zoo's front-end designer to give us client-side code.
